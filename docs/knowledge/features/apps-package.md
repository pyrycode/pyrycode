# `internal/apps` — durable host-app registrations

This package owns strict manifest validation and durable registrations independent
of conversations. The [hosted-app reference](../../hosted-apps.md#manifest-and-identity)
owns the field tables and registration behavior; the
[v1 contract](../../specs/architecture/3120-hosted-app-contract.md) owns the broader
hosting design. Registration proves neither publication nor readiness. Lifecycle
mutations and restart normalization remain #3144; publication checks remain #3125.

## Validation and stored identity

Exact JSON schema validation must precede Go struct decoding. A decoder using
`DisallowUnknownFields` still accepts case variants of struct keys, so a later
`APP_ID` or `REVISION` can mask an invalid canonical value. `strictJSON` rejects
duplicates, nulls and trailing values; `validStorageSchema` and `storageObject`
then require exact mandatory/optional keys at snapshot, record, tombstone and
last-error levels. `ValidateManifest` separately enforces exact manifest keys and
the fixed v1 values. Do not relax storage validation to the wire contract's
additive unknown-field policy.

Existing storage must decode into a zero-value snapshot. Prefilling it with the
caller's host ID makes a missing stored `server_id` appear local and can open the
same corrupt file under different hosts. `Open` initializes the caller identity
only when storage is missing, validates the stored host otherwise, and leaves
rejected bytes untouched. The canonical UUIDv4 check reuses
[`identity.ParseServerID`](identity-package.md#parseserverid--validation).
Identity is `(server_id, app_id)`; separate hosts require separate roots.

## Manifest updates and retention

The stored manifest can describe a candidate title/release while the committed
record still describes the previous one. `Registry.UpdateManifest` changes only
the manifest and record revision; it preserves committed title, active/pending
release, desired/state and last error. Treating the manifest as an activated
release would bypass publication and health confirmation.

`Registry.Remove` retains source/build/data and permanently tombstones the ID.
Tombstones survive reopen and are excluded from the 256 live-registration limit;
discarding them to bound storage would permit removed identities to be reused.

## Concurrency and persistence

`Registry.change` holds one mutex across validation, detached candidate creation,
persistence and the committed snapshot swap. Even the unchanging host ID must be
read under that lock: reading `snapshot.ServerID` outside it races with replacement
of the whole snapshot. Constancy of the value does not make its containing storage
immutable. `TestPersistenceAndVisibility` exercises concurrent registrations and
readers, blocks a writer before commit and checks that readers cannot pass it.

Detect semantic no-ops before revision exhaustion. An identical registration or
manifest update, or repeated removal of a tombstone, still succeeds without a
change at the maximum sequence. A failed write never swaps committed memory.
`Registry.List` returns records and host revision from one detached snapshot,
including independent last-error values. Use one registry owner per root;
independent owners and cross-process writes to the same root are unsupported.

## Testing

`TestStorageExactKeys` distinguishes required omissions from optional omissions
and rejects aliases at each storage level. `TestStorageAliasShadowing` supplies
raw JSON with an invalid canonical value followed by a valid case alias, including
missing-host inputs checked against two hosts. A normal struct round-trip cannot
produce these corrupt documents. Both tests check byte-for-byte preservation of
rejected storage and exposed the prior decoder bug; broad green gates alone had
missed it. See [development verification](development-verification.md#protocol-boundaries)
for missing/null/type and serialization checks.

Lowercase UUID rejection fixtures need hexadecimal letters: uppercasing a
digits-only UUID changes nothing. `TestManifestBoundaries` uses `AAAAAAAA` to
exercise this boundary, alongside UTF-8 byte limits and exact manifest constraints.
