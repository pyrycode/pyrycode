# `internal/sessions` Package

The session-addressable runtime layer that wraps `internal/supervisor` with identity (`SessionID`) and registry (`Pool`) semantics. One `Pool` holds the set of supervised claude instances managed by a single `pyry` process.

Today the pool holds exactly one entry — the **bootstrap session** — so external behaviour is unchanged from the pre-Phase-1 supervisor-only world. The package shape is the seam Phase 1.1+ extends additively (multi-session CLI, `pyry attach <id>`, idle eviction) without touching `internal/supervisor`.

## Status

- **Phase 1.0a (#28):** package introduced, fully tested, no production consumers.
- **Phase 1.0b (#29):** consumers wired. `cmd/pyry/main.go` constructs the `Pool`; `internal/control` resolves session state via a `SessionResolver` interface defined in the control package. Wire protocol unchanged; `pyry status`/`stop`/`logs`/`attach` are byte-identical to Phase 0.
- **Phase 1.1+:** `Pool.Add(SessionConfig)`, errgroup fan-out in `Pool.Run`, `Request.SessionID` on the wire, `claude --session-id <uuid>` invocation, per-session log lines.

## Package Layout

```
internal/sessions/
  id.go         SessionID, NewID()
  session.go    Session: wraps one supervisor + optional bridge
  pool.go       Pool: registry, lifecycle, Config, SessionConfig
```

## Key Types

### `SessionID`

```go
type SessionID string

func NewID() (SessionID, error)
```

A 36-char canonical UUIDv4 (`8-4-4-4-12` hex with dashes), drawn from `crypto/rand`. No external UUID library — stdlib only, ~15 lines. The version (`b[6] = b[6]&0x0f | 0x40`) and variant (`b[8] = b[8]&0x3f | 0x80`) bits are set explicitly.

The empty `SessionID` (`""`) is the **unset sentinel**, never a valid generated ID. `Pool.Lookup("")` resolves to the default entry — the mechanism that lets future handlers call `Lookup(req.SessionID)` against an empty wire field without a special case.

### `Session`

```go
type Session struct { /* id, sup, bridge, log */ }

func (s *Session) ID() SessionID
func (s *Session) State() supervisor.State
func (s *Session) Attach(in io.Reader, out io.Writer) (done <-chan struct{}, err error)
func (s *Session) Run(ctx context.Context) error
```

One supervised claude instance plus the bridge that mediates its I/O in service mode. All four methods are pure delegation to the underlying `*supervisor.Supervisor` / `*supervisor.Bridge`:

- `State()` returns the supervisor's snapshot — same safe-from-any-goroutine contract.
- `Attach` returns `ErrAttachUnavailable` when `bridge == nil` (foreground mode); otherwise delegates to `(*supervisor.Bridge).Attach`. `supervisor.ErrBridgeBusy` is propagated **verbatim** so callers' `errors.Is` checks keep working.
- `Run(ctx)` blocks until ctx cancellation. The supervisor's `Run` returns `ctx.Err()` regardless of how the child exits; `Session.Run` inherits that.

The `log` field is written by the constructor but not read in 1.0 (no per-session log lines yet — see [parent ADR](../decisions/003-session-addressable-runtime.md)). Kept on the struct so 1.1 can attach without reshaping.

### `Pool`

```go
type Pool struct { /* mu RWMutex, sessions map, bootstrap, log */ }

func New(cfg Config) (*Pool, error)
func (p *Pool) Lookup(id SessionID) (*Session, error)
func (p *Pool) Default() *Session
func (p *Pool) Run(ctx context.Context) error
```

`New` generates a `SessionID`, constructs the underlying `*supervisor.Supervisor` from `cfg.Bootstrap`, and installs the result as the single bootstrap entry. Both `NewID` failure and `supervisor.New` failure are wrapped (`sessions: generate bootstrap id: %w`, `sessions: bootstrap supervisor: %w`) and treated as fatal-at-startup.

`Lookup`:

- empty id → bootstrap entry, no error
- known id → that entry
- non-empty unknown id → `ErrSessionNotFound` (sentinel, matchable via `errors.Is`)

`Default()` is a separate accessor with the same body minus the empty-string branch — startup paths that need the bootstrap don't carry an `error` return they know is impossible.

`Run` calls `bootstrap.Run(ctx)` directly; **no errgroup in 1.0**. The errgroup fan-out is the Phase 1.1 extension point and lands with the first multi-session test.

### `Config` / `SessionConfig`

```go
type Config struct {
    Bootstrap SessionConfig
    Logger    *slog.Logger
}

type SessionConfig struct {
    ClaudeBin  string
    WorkDir    string
    ResumeLast bool
    ClaudeArgs []string
    Bridge     *supervisor.Bridge // nil = foreground

    BackoffInitial time.Duration
    BackoffMax     time.Duration
    BackoffReset   time.Duration
}
```

`SessionConfig` mirrors the relevant fields of `supervisor.Config`; `New` translates one to the other. Defaults (claude bin lookup, backoff timings) are applied by `supervisor.New` — `sessions.New` does **not** duplicate them.

`ResumeLast` maps to `--continue` on restart, as today. The locked-design `claude --session-id <uuid>` invocation is deliberately **not** plumbed in 1.0 — Phase 1.1+ adds it.

## Concurrency

`sync.RWMutex` on `Pool.sessions`:

- `Lookup` and `Default` take the read lock.
- `Run` takes the read lock once briefly to grab the bootstrap pointer.
- No writers in 1.0. Phase 1.1's `Pool.Add(SessionConfig)` will take the write lock without changing `Run`.

The RLock around the bootstrap read in `Run` is overkill today (no writers exist) but documents the contract: `p.sessions` is shared, all reads take the read lock. When 1.1 introduces writers there is no "but here we don't lock" rule.

No new goroutines are introduced in this layer. The PTY spawn / wait / backoff loop, the I/O bridge goroutines, and the SIGWINCH watcher all remain in their existing packages.

## Errors

| Condition | Surface |
|---|---|
| `NewID` rng failure | `sessions.New` returns wrapped error. Fatal. |
| `supervisor.New` failure | Wrapped: `sessions: bootstrap supervisor: %w`. Fatal. |
| `Pool.Lookup` unknown id | `ErrSessionNotFound` (sentinel). |
| `Session.Attach` with nil bridge | `ErrAttachUnavailable` (sentinel). |
| `Session.Attach` while bridge busy | `supervisor.ErrBridgeBusy` propagated **verbatim** — no wrap. |
| `Session.Run` / `Pool.Run` ctx cancel | `context.Canceled` from the supervisor. |

Sentinels (`ErrSessionNotFound`, `ErrAttachUnavailable`) live in `internal/sessions`. `supervisor.ErrBridgeBusy` stays in `internal/supervisor`.

## Dependency Direction

```
internal/sessions  →  internal/supervisor
```

`internal/sessions` imports `internal/supervisor`. The reverse is forbidden — verifiable with `go list -deps ./internal/supervisor/...`. `internal/sessions` does **not** import `internal/control`; control will (after Phase 1.0b) import sessions for `SessionID` and the resolver interface, never the other way around.

## Testing

Three test files mirror the production layout. Stdlib `testing` only.

- **`id_test.go`** — format regex match, 1000-iteration uniqueness smoke test for `crypto/rand` wiring.
- **`pool_test.go`** — bootstrap installation, `Lookup("")` ↔ `Default()` identity, lookup by ID, unknown-ID sentinel match. Uses `/bin/sleep` as the "claude" binary; tests never call `Run`, so it's never spawned.
- **`session_test.go`** — `State` delegation, `Attach` with no bridge, `Attach` busy via `io.Pipe` (first attach blocks on input, second races and gets `supervisor.ErrBridgeBusy`), `Run` ctx-cancel via a real `/bin/sleep 3600` child.

### Why no `TestHelperProcess` re-exec helper

The parent spec considered duplicating `internal/supervisor`'s `TestHelperProcess` re-exec pattern into the sessions package (~20 lines) per the project's "duplicate, don't export test surface" convention. The blocker: `supervisor.Config.helperEnv` is unexported and is the only way to pass test-only env to the spawned child without polluting the parent test process's `os.Environ()`. External packages cannot set it.

The chosen workaround is to use a real benign binary (`/bin/sleep`) as the fake claude. No re-exec, no env injection, no helper duplication. The supervisor spawns it, ctx cancellation kills it, `supervisor.Run` returns `ctx.Err()` — which is the only contract the test asserts.

`/bin/sleep` exists on both Linux and macOS; CI runs both. If a future CI environment lacks it, `t.Skipf` on `exec.LookPath` failure rather than silently passing.

## Production Consumers (Phase 1.0b)

After #29, `cmd/pyry/main.go` constructs `*sessions.Pool` and `internal/control` consumes a `SessionResolver` (defined inside `internal/control` — see [control-plane.md](control-plane.md)). External behaviour is unchanged:

- `Request`/`Response` JSON shapes unchanged. No `session_id` field yet.
- No new log lines; the bootstrap session ID is **not** logged.
- Startup log line preserved verbatim (`pyrycode starting` with the same fields).
- `pyry status`/`stop`/`logs`/`attach` are byte-identical to Phase 0.
- Foreground vs service mode keys off `term.IsTerminal(os.Stdin.Fd())` in `cmd/pyry/main.go`, unchanged.
- Restart still uses `--continue`. `claude --session-id <uuid>` is **not** plumbed in 1.0.

`*sessions.Pool` does not satisfy `control.SessionResolver` directly: `Pool.Lookup` returns the concrete `*sessions.Session`, while the resolver interface returns `control.Session`. Go does not do covariant return types on interface satisfaction, so `cmd/pyry` defines a 5-line `poolResolver` adapter to bridge the two. See [lessons.md](../../lessons.md#interface-adapters-for-covariant-returns) and [control-plane.md](control-plane.md).
