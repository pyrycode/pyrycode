# `internal/thread` — conversation-owned history fold

`Fold` builds deterministic items from supplied raw `history.Entry` values for
one conversation. `Store` owns background replay and tailing for independently
loaded conversations. Both implement the history-backed storage design of
[ADR 042](../decisions/042-daemon-built-thread.md); daemon wiring remains downstream.
Use [raw history and its metadata](history-package-shape.md#shape), including
hidden facts; legacy receipt projections discard facts needed by the fold.
