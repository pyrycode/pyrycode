# `internal/streamsup` — persistent stream-json child lifecycle

Stream-json sibling of [`internal/supervisor`](../architecture/system-overview.md) (the PTY path): supervises a **long-lived, multi-turn** headless `claude` child instead of hosting a screen. Where [`streamrunner`](streamrunner-package.md) spawns claude for one turn, writes the envelope, closes stdin, and exits, `streamsup` spawns claude **once per crash cycle**, holds its stdin open across many turns, and restarts it with the supervisor's backoff ladder on crash. This is the process-lifecycle-only first slice (#1087); it ships unwired — no pool, relay, or `cmd/pyry` consumer yet.

**No transcript tailing lives in this package.** That is the entire point of the stream-json path: it structurally removes the `<uuid>.jsonl` bind-latency race the PTY path fought (#528/#996/#989). The only filesystem canonicalisation `streamsup` performs is resolving `WorkDir` via `agentrun.ResolveWorkdir` before spawn (macOS `/tmp` → `/private/tmp`, the #989 symlink hazard) — no fsnotify, no JSONL-path resolution anywhere.

## Public API

```go
type Config struct {
    ClaudeBin      string        // required; resolved path to claude
    WorkDir        string        // required; resolved via agentrun.ResolveWorkdir in New
    SessionID      string        // required; caller-minted claude session UUID
    Args           []string      // pass-through argv (e.g. --model <m>); New clones it
    Stdout         io.Writer     // optional; nil → child stdout discarded (/dev/null)
    Stderr         io.Writer     // optional; nil → discarded
    Env            []string      // optional; appended to os.Environ() in the child
    Logger         *slog.Logger  // optional; nil → slog.Default()
    BackoffInitial time.Duration // zero → 500ms
    BackoffMax     time.Duration // zero → 30s
    BackoffReset   time.Duration // zero → 60s
}

func New(cfg Config) (*Runner, error)
func (r *Runner) Run(ctx context.Context) error // blocks until ctx cancel; supervise loop
func (r *Runner) Stdin() io.Writer               // held-open stdin, or nil between spawns
```

`New` validates `ClaudeBin`/`WorkDir`/`SessionID` non-empty, `exec.LookPath`s the binary, resolves `WorkDir` (a missing dir → wrapped `fs.ErrNotExist`), and applies backoff defaults. `Stdin()` returns `io.Writer`, not `io.WriteCloser` — deliberately, so a consumer (the #1088 turn writer) cannot close a handle the runner owns; it returns nil whenever no child is currently live (before first spawn, mid-restart, during teardown).

## `buildArgs` — the id-flag inversion that keeps the on-disk session stable

```go
func buildArgs(base []string, firstRun bool, sessionID string) []string
```

Pure function, assembled fresh each spawn (never mutates `base`):

1. Fixed stream-json prefix: `--input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --verbose`. **Never `-p`/`--print`** — the non-`-p` choice is billing-classification-tied and was spike-verified live (#1075): multi-turn, interrupt, resume, and the approval round-trip all work without it.
2. Then the caller's `base` (`Config.Args`, e.g. `--model <m>`).
3. Then the id flag: **first spawn** → `--session-id <sessionID>` (establishes the on-disk transcript under a known id); **every respawn** → `--resume <sessionID>` (reattach, append, **no fork** — `--fork-session` is the explicit, unused opt-in).

Passing the *same* `sessionID` to both flags is why the on-disk session id survives a kill-and-restart untouched — pool id bookkeeping (eviction/reactivation) never has to reconcile a forked id. Mirrors the daemon bootstrap's deterministic-`--session-id` precedent (#839).

## Held-open stdin — the deliberate inversion from `streamrunner`

`streamrunner.Run` (#390/#391) closes the child's stdin after writing one turn envelope — it's a single-turn primitive. `streamsup` is the opposite: `cmd.StdinPipe()` is opened before `cmd.Start()`, the write end is stored under a leaf mutex, and **it is never closed while the child is alive**. Turn envelopes are written onto it by the #1088 follow-on slice; this slice only owns the handle's lifecycle:

- On spawn: `setStdin(stdin)` publishes the new handle, then the unexported `onSpawn(pid)` test seam fires (nil in production).
- On exit (crash or ctx-cancel teardown): `takeStdin()` clears the field first — so `Stdin()` reports "no live child" immediately — then closes the old handle **outside** the lock. `cmd.Wait()` has usually already closed the parent write end, so a broken-pipe / already-closed error here is expected; it's filtered through [`agentrun.ExitErrIsBenign`](agentrun-package.md) to avoid a spurious Warn (same discipline as `streamrunner`).

## Supervise loop (`Run`)

Mirrors `supervisor.Run`'s restart/backoff/resume shape, minus the live-restart (`restartCh`) seam — that's a `supervisor`-only concern this slice omits:

```
loop:
  if ctx.Err() != nil → return ctx.Err()             // graceful shutdown, not a crash
  args := buildArgs(Args, firstRun, SessionID)
  started, waitErr := spawnAndWait(ctx, args)          // blocks until child exits
  if ctx.Err() != nil → return ctx.Err()               // teardown, not a crash
  if started → firstRun = false                        // see the firstRun gate below
  delay := backoff.next(uptime)
  select { <-time.After(delay) | <-ctx.Done() → return ctx.Err() }
```

Shutdown is detected via **parent-ctx cancellation**, never via the child-exit error value — `spawnAndWait`'s `waitErr` only ever means "crashed" once `ctx.Err()` has been checked and is nil. One goroutine total (the caller's `Run`); `cmd.Wait` blocks it, and os/exec runs its own internal ctx-watcher goroutine that invokes `cmd.Cancel` off-loop.

### `firstRun` gate: only advances on a successful `cmd.Start` (fix 66cc50e)

`spawnAndWait` returns `(started bool, waitErr error)`. `started` is `false` only when the spawn fails during **setup** (`cmd.StdinPipe()` or `cmd.Start()` erroring) — claude never launched, so `--session-id` never ran and the on-disk session was never established. The original implementation flipped `firstRun = false` unconditionally after every iteration; a transient setup failure (e.g. a momentarily-unavailable binary) would make the *next* attempt respawn with `--resume <id>` against a session that was never created, and claude would error ("no conversation found") on every subsequent attempt — a permanent, unrecoverable crash-loop that defeated the very retry the backoff loop exists for. Fixed by threading `started` through and gating the flip: `if started { firstRun = false }`. A setup failure now correctly retries with `--session-id` until one succeeds. Regression test drives `Run` against a non-existent binary and asserts every retry keeps `--session-id`.

## Teardown: SIGTERM → SIGKILL grace + descendant-group reap

Same shape as [`streamrunner`](streamrunner-package.md#teardown-reap-descendant-process-groups-reapgo-924), copied verbatim down to the seam name:

```go
cmd.Cancel = func() error {
    reapDescendantGroupsFn(cmd.Process.Pid, r.log)
    return cmd.Process.Signal(syscall.SIGTERM)
}
cmd.WaitDelay = killGrace // 5 * time.Second
```

`cmd.Cancel` fires only on ctx cancellation (stdlib's ctx-watcher), never on a spontaneous crash — matching the proven streamrunner/ptyrunner behaviour; there is no evidence claude orphans descendant Bash process groups on its own exit, so no speculative crash-path reaping was added (Evidence-Based Fix Selection). `reapDescendantGroupsFn` is a package-var seam defaulting to [`agentrun.ReapDescendantGroups`](agentrun-package.md), swapped in tests via a mutex-guarded recorder.

## Dependency direction (AC1)

Imports only stdlib and the shared parent `internal/agentrun` (`ResolveWorkdir`, `ExitErrIsBenign`, `ReapDescendantGroups`). Must not import `internal/supervisor` (the PTY helper) nor any sibling `agentrun` subpackage (`streamrunner`, `ptyrunner`, …). The `backoffTimer` is **copied verbatim** into `backoff.go` rather than imported from `internal/supervisor`, specifically to preserve this boundary — the two are expected to stay byte-identical; the lifted `backoff_test.go` ladder table guards both independently. Verify with:

```bash
go list -deps ./internal/streamsup/... | grep pyrycode/internal/supervisor   # expect: empty
```

## Testing

Table-driven stdlib `testing`, `go test -race`. Fake-child harness dispatches from `TestMain` on `GO_STREAMSUP_HELPER=1` **before `flag.Parse`** — not streamrunner's `os.Args[0]` + `-test.run` re-exec trick, because `buildArgs` prepends the fixed stream-json flags *ahead of* the caller's args, so a `-test.run` flag can never be made to sort first; `go test` would exit 2 on the unknown leading flag before the helper ever ran. Dispatching from `TestMain` on an env var sidesteps flag parsing entirely. Modes keyed by `GO_STREAMSUP_HELPER_MODE`: `echo_lines` (proves stdin stays open — echoes each line, only emits `GOT_EOF` if EOF is actually reached), `block_sigterm` (teardown grace test), `crash` (forces respawns; optionally records its own argv to `GO_STREAMSUP_HELPER_ARGV_FILE` for the resume-id-stability assertion).

Scenarios: `buildArgs` shape (pure, table — fixed prefix present, `-p` absent, `--session-id` vs `--resume`, id byte-identical across first-spawn/respawn, `base` order preserved and not mutated); held-open stdin (echo round-trip + `GOT_EOF` absent while alive); backoff ladder (lifted `supervisor.backoff_test.go` verbatim against the copied `backoffTimer`); restart-on-crash (≥2 spawns observed via `onSpawn`); resume-id-stable-across-restart (captured argv: spawn 1 has `--session-id <id>`, spawn 2 has `--resume <id>`, same id); teardown SIGTERM+grace (`Run` returns within `< killGrace`, "got SIGTERM" on stderr); teardown reaps descendant groups (`reapDescendantGroupsFn` swap, non-parallel); the `firstRun`-gate regression test (non-existent binary, every retry keeps `--session-id`).

## Out of scope (follow-on slices)

- **Turn I/O** (#1088) — the stdin envelope writer (marshals a turn onto `Stdin()`, treating nil as a "no live child" refusal) and the stdout→turnevent parser (the sink `Config.Stdout` plugs into).
- **turncommit/idle/stall gates** (#1089) — build on the seams this slice exposes.
- **Pool/relay/`cmd/pyry` wiring** — this slice ships unwired by design.
